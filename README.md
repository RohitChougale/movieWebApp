Overview
This is a feature-rich Angular application built to showcase my front-end development skills. The application demonstrates a variety of core Angular features, including routing, data binding, and a well-structured, scalable codebase. It has been designed with best practices in mind to ensure maintainability and performance.

Features:
    ðŸ”¹ Routing -
              Implemented Angular routing for seamless navigation between different views.
              Used route guards to secure specific sections of the application.
              Lazy loading implemented for optimized performance and reduced initial load time.
    ðŸ”¹ Data Binding -
              Utilized two-way data binding for dynamic updates between the UI and the component.
              Applied property binding and event binding for efficient communication between the template and logic.
    ðŸ”¹ Well-Structured Code
              Modular architecture for better scalability and maintainability.
              Followed Angular best practices, such as separating components, services, and modules logically.
              Reusable and dynamic components for a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.
